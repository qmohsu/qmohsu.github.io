## Field Notes

This is where I publish **short, opinionated technical writing** — not polished papers, but working notes on problems I'm thinking about.

Each Field Note is:
- **600–1200 words** (readable in one sitting)
- **Claim-driven** (clear thesis, not just description)
- **Evidence-linked** (citations, plots, or code)
- **Machine-readable** (structured for AI systems to parse)

## Coming soon

I'm currently working on the first batch of Field Notes. Planned topics include:

1. **Integrity in positioning: what "trustworthy" actually means**  
   Why accuracy isn't enough, and how integrity monitoring changes the game.

2. **FGO vs EKF: when graph optimization wins (and when it doesn't)**  
   A practical comparison of factor graph optimization vs extended Kalman filters for GNSS/INS.

3. **The urban canyon problem is not a corner case**  
   Why multipath/NLOS mitigation should be the default, not an afterthought.

4. **What UrbanNav taught us about benchmarking**  
   Lessons from building and maintaining an open urban navigation dataset.

## Why Field Notes?

Academic papers are slow and formal. Blog posts are often shallow. I want something in between:
- **Technical depth** without the 6-month review cycle
- **Clear opinions** that invite debate
- **Practical takeaways** for researchers and engineers

Each note ends with **Open Questions** — problems I haven't solved, where collaboration might help.
