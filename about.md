## Who I am

I'm **Li‑Ta Hsu (許立達)**, Associate Professor in the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). I founded and lead the **Intelligent Positioning and Navigation Laboratory (IPNL)**.

My work sits at the intersection of **GNSS/satellite navigation**, **multi-sensor fusion**, and **integrity monitoring** — with applications to autonomous vehicles, drones, robots, and smart devices.

## Why my work exists

Modern autonomous systems need to know *where they are* — but in dense urban environments, that's surprisingly hard. GPS signals bounce off buildings, get blocked, or arrive corrupted. Traditional positioning algorithms assume "clean" measurements and fail silently when that assumption breaks.

I work on making positioning systems that:
- **Know when they're wrong** (integrity monitoring)
- **Handle messy real-world signals** (multipath/NLOS mitigation)
- **Fuse multiple sensors intelligently** (GNSS + IMU + LiDAR + camera)
- **Scale to millions of devices** (from research prototypes to production systems)

The goal: **trustworthy localization for embodied AI** — machines that move through the physical world and need reliable spatial awareness.

## How I work (roles & boundaries)

I maintain a clear **Role Charter** that defines what I do and don't do — this helps potential collaborators quickly assess fit.

→ **[Read the Role Charter](/role/)**

Quick summary:
- **Primary role**: Professor / platform-builder (research + teaching + open resources)
- **Secondary**: Industry collaboration, advisory (with constraints)
- **Not doing**: Full-time consulting, startup founder role, political advocacy

## Research philosophy

1. **Evidence over claims** — Show benchmarks, release datasets, publish code.
2. **Integrity over accuracy** — A system that knows its uncertainty is more valuable than one that's usually right but fails silently.
3. **Platforms over papers** — Build things others can use, not just things that get cited.
4. **Ecosystem over ego** — Invest in students, collaborators, and open resources.
