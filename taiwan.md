## Why Taiwan matters (for this work)

Taiwan has world-class expertise in **semiconductors**, **GNSS chipsets**, **smart devices**, and **autonomous systems**. Companies like MediaTek and Airoha are global leaders in positioning technology. Universities have strong programs in navigation, robotics, and AI.

I'm building a **Taiwan research node** — a set of concrete, measurable collaborations that create mutual value:

- **For Taiwan partners**: Access to Hong Kong/global research network, open datasets, and benchmark infrastructure.
- **For my research program**: Real-world deployment contexts, industry connections, and student talent.

This is not a vague "international collaboration" — it's a deliberate **second base** for my research program.

## Current / target partners

I'm actively building relationships with:

- **Universities**: National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), National Taiwan University (NTU), National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), and others with navigation/robotics programs.
- **Industry**: MediaTek, Airoha Technology, and companies working on positioning for smart devices, vehicles, and drones.
- **Government/agencies**: Research councils and innovation programs supporting navigation and autonomous systems.

*(If you're at one of these institutions and want to connect, see below.)*

## Planned activities (Phase 1: 2025–2026)

### 1. Joint workshops
- Co-organized technical workshops on urban navigation, integrity monitoring, or multi-sensor fusion.
- Target: 1–2 workshops in Taiwan per year.

### 2. Dataset extensions
- Extend **UrbanNav** with Taiwan urban canyon data (Taipei, Kaohsiung, etc.).
- Collaborate on sensor setups, data collection protocols, and benchmark tasks.

### 3. Student exchange & visiting opportunities
- Short-term visits (1–3 months) for graduate students or postdocs.
- Co-advised thesis projects.
- Research internships at IPNL (Hong Kong) for Taiwan students.

### 4. Joint publications & projects
- Co-authored papers with Taiwan collaborators.
- Joint grant proposals (Taiwan–Hong Kong or international).

## What I'm looking for

I'm interested in partners who want to:

| Activity | What you bring | What I bring |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Workshop** | Venue, local audience, co-organizer effort | Technical program, speakers, IPNL network |
| **Dataset extension** | Local data collection, sensors, driving routes | Benchmark protocols, existing UrbanNav infrastructure, publication support |
| **Student exchange** | Motivated students, travel funding | Research supervision, lab resources, co-authorship |
| **Joint project** | Domain expertise, local deployment context | Algorithm development, open-source code, publication track record |
