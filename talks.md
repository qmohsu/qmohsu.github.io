## Recent Featured Talk

### The Intelligent Driving Wave: Transforming Transportation Infrastructure  
**July 12, 2025** | UOW College Hong Kong | Co-organized with Taiwan Automotive & Transportation Industry Union

Keynote addressing the $2.2T autonomous vehicle transformation and its impact on transportation workers. Presented three industry scenarios (conservative, accelerated, disrupted) and Hong Kong's strategic role as regional smart transportation hub. Discussed practical solutions: fleet management systems (FMS) as ITS platform, 3D mapping-aided GNSS for urban positioning, and AI-driven vehicle health monitoring.

**Key partnerships**: Collaboration with Taiwan labor unions on intelligent driving workforce transitions, government Smart Traffic Fund support, and industrial sponsors (SAIC Motor, Meituan, HONOR).
