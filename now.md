## My 10-year roadmap for trustworthy embodied navigation

This page shows what I'm working on across three time horizons. Updated periodically.

---

## Now (2025–2026) — Stabilize + prune + create options

**Theme:** Establish clear identity as Professor / platform-builder. Build the Taiwan option.

### Research focus
- **Integrity-constrained positioning** — Graph optimization with integrity bounds for urban GNSS
- **UrbanNav ecosystem** — Dataset maintenance, benchmark protocols, community support
- **Multi-sensor fusion foundations** — GNSS/LiDAR/IMU tight coupling research

### Platform building
- Maintain and document open-source releases (UrbanNav, GraphGNSSLib)
- Publish **Field Notes** — short technical posts for machine-readable knowledge sharing
- Build this website as a long-term "option machine"

### Taiwan Node (priority)
- Establish 2–3 active collaborations with Taiwan universities/companies
- Co-organize at least 1 workshop in Taiwan
- Explore UrbanNav Taiwan extension (Taipei/Kaohsiung data)

### Community
- Continue ION Technical Representative role
- IPIN 2024 conference wrap-up and proceedings
- Mentor current PhD students to graduation

### Key deliverables
- [ ] 3+ journal publications on integrity/FGO
- [ ] 6–10 Field Notes published
- [ ] Taiwan Node: 1 workshop + 1 dataset extension started
- [ ] 2+ PhD students graduated

---

## Next (2027–2029) — Build a flagship "spine" project

**Theme:** Converge scattered work into one coherent research program.

### Flagship initiative (planned)
**"Integrity-first localization stack for embodied agents in urban/indoor environments"**

This will be the anchor for everything:
- A unified problem framing
- Reference implementations
- Benchmark suite
- Annual "state of the field" assessment

### Research focus
- Unified integrity framework across GNSS, LiDAR, vision
- Indoor-outdoor transition handling
- Scalable deployment (from research prototypes to production)

### Platform building
- Flagship landing page: problem → method → evidence → impact → roadmap
- Benchmark infrastructure for community adoption
- Reference implementations with clear APIs

### Expected outcomes
- Flagship page becomes top-cited resource in the field
- External adoption: PRs, issues, third-party baselines
- Speaking invites referencing the flagship concept

---

## Later (2030–2035) — Choose primary base based on evidence

**Theme:** Mature portfolio. Cross-region builder with clear stance.

### What success looks like
- **Adoption**: Industry pilots, standards contributions, lab spinoffs
- **People**: Strong alumni network, placed graduates, ecosystem growth
- **Recognition**: Known for a specific, valuable contribution to the field
- **Optionality**: Clear evidence to inform base location decision

### Planned deliverables
- "Impact & Adoption" page — who used what, outcomes, citations, press
- "Mentoring & Alumni" page — students, placements, ecosystem map
- Mature press kit with established talking points

### Open questions
- Where should my primary base be? (Evidence will inform this.)
- What's the next frontier after embodied navigation?
- How do I transition from building to maintaining?
