## Why this page exists

People often ask me to do things outside my core focus. This page makes my boundaries explicit — so you can quickly assess whether we're a good fit before reaching out.

This is a **living document**. As my priorities shift, I'll update it.

## Primary role: Professor / Platform-builder

This is what I spend most of my time on:

### Research leadership
- Direct research on GNSS, urban navigation, integrity monitoring, multi-sensor fusion
- Supervise PhD students, postdocs, and research staff
- Publish papers, release datasets, open-source code
- Build research infrastructure (benchmarks, tools, protocols)

### Teaching
- Graduate and undergraduate courses at PolyU
- Student mentorship and career development
- Curriculum development for navigation/positioning

### Community service
- Conference organization (e.g., IPIN 2024 chair)
- Technical program committees (ION GNSS+, IEEE conferences)
- Peer review for journals and funding agencies
- ION Technical Representative (elected)

### Open platforms
- Maintain and extend **UrbanNav** dataset
- Support **GraphGNSSLib** and related tools
- Enable other researchers to build on my work

**This is my default mode.** If you want to engage with me, these activities get priority.

## Secondary role: Industry collaboration & advisory

I selectively engage with industry when it:
- Advances my research agenda
- Creates real-world impact
- Doesn't conflict with academic commitments

### What I do
- Joint R&D projects with industry partners
- Technical advisory for product teams (scoped engagements)
- Invited talks and tutorials at companies
- Technology evaluation and benchmarking
- Visiting research roles (like my time at Google)

### What I need
- Clear problem statement and success criteria
- Reasonable time commitment
- Appropriate compensation or research value
- Ability to publish (at least partially) when possible

### Constraints
- No full-time consulting or contractor roles
- No equity-only compensation
- No conflicts with existing commitments
- No pressure to endorse products

See [Collaboration](/collaboration/) for details on how to engage.

## What I don't do

To be explicit, here's what I'm **not available for**:

| Category | What I decline |
|----------|---------------|
| **Time commitments** | Full-time consulting, open-ended advisory without scope |
| **Compensation** | Equity-only deals, unpaid "exposure" work |
| **Conflicts** | Roles that compete with my academic position |
| **Endorsements** | Product testimonials, marketing appearances |
| **Politics** | Lobbying, political advocacy, partisan statements |
| **Secrecy** | Work that can never be published or discussed |
| **Vague asks** | "Let's chat sometime" without specific goals |

If your request falls into these categories, please don't be offended if I decline quickly.

## How to assess fit

Before reaching out, ask yourself:

1. **Does this align with my research interests?**  
   → See [Research](/research/)

2. **Is there a clear deliverable or outcome?**  
   → Vague collaborations waste everyone's time.

3. **Can the work eventually be published or shared?**  
   → I prioritize work that contributes to the public knowledge base.

4. **Is the timeline realistic?**  
   → Academic research is slow. Quick turnarounds are hard.

5. **Is this the right person?**  
   → If you need someone full-time, you need a consultant, not a professor.

## Current priorities (2025)

What I'm actively saying **yes** to:

- Taiwan research partnerships ([Taiwan Node](/taiwan/))
- Urban GNSS benchmarking and dataset extensions
- Integrity monitoring for safety-critical applications
- Factor graph optimization research
- Strong PhD/postdoc candidates

What I'm actively saying **no** to:

- General "AI" projects without navigation focus
- Unpaid advisory board seats
- Requests without clear scope or timeline
