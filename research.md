## Research interests
My core research interests include:
- **Urban navigation**
- **GNSS signal processing**
- **GNSS precise positioning** (e.g., RTK / PPP‑RTK)
- **Multi‑sensor fusion** (GNSS/IMU/LiDAR/camera)
- **Indoor positioning & indoor navigation**
- **Unmanned autonomous systems**
- **Intelligent transportation systems**

(For an always up‑to‑date publication list, see my PolyU Scholars Hub and Google Scholar profiles on the homepage.)

## Research themes (what I actually work on)

### 1) Robust GNSS positioning in complex urban environments
**Multipath/NLOS** is not a corner case — it’s the default in dense cities. I work on:
- NLOS / multipath detection & mitigation
- Non‑Gaussian measurement modeling
- GNSS integrity monitoring for safety‑critical applications

### 2) Factor graph optimization for GNSS and GNSS/INS
I use factor graphs (and related probabilistic optimization) to build:
- GNSS/INS fusion alternatives to EKF pipelines
- Constraint‑aware positioning
- Research platforms for urban GNSS precise positioning

### 3) 3D mapping‑aided positioning (3DMA GNSS) + environment awareness
This line of work uses prior maps and perception:
- 3D city models / building models
- LiDAR‑aided environment reconstruction
- Map‑aided positioning and reliability assessment

### 4) Tightly coupled multi‑sensor fusion (GNSS/LiDAR/IMU/camera)
Continuous, drift‑free navigation needs robust fusion:
- LiDAR‑inertial odometry
- Visual‑inertial navigation (VIO)
- Fusion frameworks that stay stable in adverse conditions

### 5) Smartphone positioning / Android GNSS
Smartphone GNSS is noisy and constrained — and that makes it a great research testbed:
- Models and inference robust to low‑cost sensors
- Urban positioning improved by learning and probabilistic fusion

### 6) Indoor positioning & indoor navigation
- UWB/INS integration
- Indoor navigation systems and deployment constraints
