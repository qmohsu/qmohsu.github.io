I build **integrity-first** navigation and sensor-fusion systems for **embodied AI** (robots, vehicles, drones) — turning messy real-world signals into trustworthy decisions.

**Recent highlights:**
- Visiting Research Scientist, Google Android Context (Jan 2023–Aug 2024)
- Open-source dataset builder ([UrbanNav](https://github.com/IPNL-POLYU/UrbanNavDataset))
- Elected ION Technical Representative (re-elected Jan 2025)

My work spans:
- **Academic research & leadership** at PolyU / IPNL (papers, grants, student supervision, community service).
- **Industry impact** (e.g., improving GNSS positioning accuracy and reliability for Android devices during my visiting role at Google's Android Context team).

## Open to opportunities
I’m open to serious, mission‑relevant conversations in:
- **Industry R&D collaboration / joint projects** (PNT, mapping, robotics, automotive, smart devices)
- **Advisory / consulting** on robust positioning, integrity monitoring, and sensor fusion
- **Invited talks / tutorials / workshops**
- **Visiting roles** and research collaboration (short‑term or long‑term)
- **Graduate student / postdoc recruitment** (PolyU / IPNL)
