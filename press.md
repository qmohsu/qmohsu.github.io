## Bio snippets

### One-liner (50 words)
Li-Ta Hsu is an Associate Professor at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, specializing in GNSS positioning, urban navigation, and sensor fusion for autonomous systems.

### Short bio (100 words)
Li-Ta Hsu is an Associate Professor in the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), where he founded the Intelligent Positioning and Navigation Laboratory (IPNL). His research focuses on robust GNSS positioning in urban environments, integrity monitoring, and multi-sensor fusion for autonomous vehicles, drones, and smart devices. He was a Visiting Research Scientist at Google's Android Context team (2023–2024) and serves as an elected ION Technical Representative. His open-source contributions include the UrbanNav dataset and GraphGNSSLib.

### Full bio (200 words)
Li-Ta Hsu is an Associate Professor in the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), where he founded and directs the Intelligent Positioning and Navigation Laboratory (IPNL). His research addresses the fundamental challenge of reliable positioning in difficult environments — urban canyons, indoor spaces, and anywhere GPS signals are degraded or unavailable.

Dr. Hsu's work spans GNSS signal processing, multipath/NLOS mitigation, integrity monitoring, factor graph optimization, and tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion (GNSS/LiDAR/IMU/camera). His research has been applied to autonomous vehicles, drones, smartphones, and robotics.

From January 2023 to August 2024, he served as a Visiting Research Scientist at Google's Android Context team, working on improving GNSS positioning for Android devices. He is an elected ION Technical Representative (re-elected January 2025) and served as Conference Chair for IPIN 2024 (Hong Kong) and Technical Program Chair for ION GNSS+ 2023.

Dr. Hsu is committed to open science, maintaining the UrbanNav dataset for urban navigation benchmarking and the GraphGNSSLib factor-graph positioning toolkit. His work aims to make positioning systems that know when they're wrong — not just systems that are usually right.
