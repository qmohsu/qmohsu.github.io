# qmohsu.github.io — starter site (AI-findable “authority hub”)

This folder contains a ready-to-upload GitHub Pages site for **Li-Ta Hsu**.

## How to publish (no coding tools needed)
1. Open your repo: `qmohsu/qmohsu.github.io`
2. Upload *all files and folders* from this starter kit into the **root** of the repo.
3. Commit the changes.
4. In GitHub repo settings: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Your site will be served at: `https://qmohsu.github.io`

## What you MUST replace / add
- `assets/img/headshot.jpg`  (your professional headshot)
- `assets/docs/cv.pdf`        (your current CV PDF)
- (optional) `assets/img/lab.jpg` (a lab/field photo)

## What you SHOULD edit first
- `index.md` — homepage positioning + links (highest leverage)
- `open.md` — datasets & open-source links
- `talks.md` — invited talks and leadership roles

## Notes (important)
- This is **text-first** and intentionally simple: better for SEO + AI indexing.
- Keep personal data minimal (no phone/home address).
- If you want a custom domain later, add a `CNAME` file.
