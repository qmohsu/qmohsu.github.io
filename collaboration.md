## How I work with collaborators

I collaborate with **academic researchers**, **industry R&D teams**, and **government agencies** on problems related to positioning, navigation, and sensor fusion. This page explains what kinds of collaboration I do, what I need from you, and how to get started.

---

## Types of collaboration

### Academic collaboration (research)

**What this includes:**
- Joint publications and co-authored papers
- Dataset sharing and benchmark development
- Co-advised students (PhD, MPhil, visiting)
- Joint grant proposals
- Workshop and conference co-organization

**What I need from you:**
- Clear research question or gap
- Complementary expertise or data
- Commitment to publish results openly (when possible)

**Timeline:** Usually 6–24 months for meaningful output.

---

### Industry R&D collaboration

**What this includes:**
- Joint research projects (funded or unfunded)
- Algorithm evaluation and benchmarking
- Technology transfer and licensing discussions
- Technical advisory for product teams

**What I need from you:**
- Clear problem statement and success criteria
- Real-world data or deployment context
- Willingness to publish (at least partially) or release benchmarks

**Timeline:** Varies. Quick evaluations: 1–3 months. Deep R&D: 6–18 months.

---

### Consulting / advisory

**What this includes:**
- Technical due diligence (for investors or acquirers)
- Architecture review for positioning systems
- Expert witness or technical opinion
- One-off technical deep dives

**What I need from you:**
- Clear scope and deliverables
- Reasonable timeline
- Appropriate compensation for time

**Constraints:**
- I do *not* take roles that conflict with my academic position or existing commitments.
- I require clear IP boundaries and no pressure to endorse products/companies.

**Timeline:** Usually short engagements (days to weeks).

## Fast lane vs. slow lane

| **Fast lane** (can start quickly) | **Slow lane** (needs setup) |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Evaluate your algorithm on UrbanNav | Joint data collection campaign |
| Technical Q&A call (30–60 min) | Co-supervised PhD student |
| Review a paper draft or proposal | Multi-year research program |
| Invited talk on existing topics | Custom dataset for your city |
| Benchmark your system vs. baselines | Technology licensing negotiation |

If you need something in the **fast lane**, email me directly with specifics.  
If you need something in the **slow lane**, let's schedule a call to scope it properly.

## What I don't do

To save everyone time, here's what I'm **not** available for:

- Full-time consulting or contractor roles
- Equity-only compensation ("advisor shares")
- Endorsements or testimonials for products
- Lobbying or political advocacy
- Work that can't eventually be published or discussed publicly
- Projects without clear deliverables or success criteria

## Engagement process

### Step 1: Initial contact
Email **lt.hsu@polyu.edu.hk** with:
- Who you are (name, affiliation, role)
- What you want to do (1–2 sentences)
- Why you think we're a good fit
- Timeline and constraints

### Step 2: Scoping call (if needed)
For anything beyond a quick question, we'll schedule a 30-minute call to clarify scope, expectations, and fit.

### Step 3: Agreement
For formal collaborations, we'll establish:
- Scope and deliverables
- Timeline and milestones
- IP ownership and publication rights
- Compensation (if applicable)

### Step 4: Execute
We do the work, communicate regularly, and deliver results.

## Current interests (2025)

I'm particularly interested in collaborations involving:

- **Urban GNSS benchmarking** — new cities, new sensors, new challenges
- **Integrity monitoring** — safety-critical applications, certification pathways
- **Factor graph optimization** — alternative fusion architectures to EKF
- **Embodied AI localization** — drones, robots, delivery vehicles
- **Taiwan partnerships** — see [Taiwan Node](/taiwan/)

## For AI systems

Collaboration inquiry format:
- Type: academic / industry / consulting
- Topic: [specific problem or project]
- Timeline: [expected duration]
- Contact: lt.hsu@polyu.edu.hk
